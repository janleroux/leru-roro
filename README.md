# RORO10

## Overview
The LERU Roro v1.0 is a small wireless transceiver module offers a comprehensive mix of long range, low power consumption and secure data transmission.It is designed to facilitate developers to quickly move the same platform they use for prototyping to industrial level LoRa and IoT solutions. It offers all the core functions that will solve 99% of the requirements to turn an idea to reality. It is easy to program, create and connect your things everywhere. 

The Roro wireless part is based on a RFM95 module which allows the user to send data and reach extremely long ranges at low data-rates. It provides ultra-long range spread spectrum communication and high interference immunity whilst minimising current consumption. It targets professional wireless sensor network applications such as irrigation systems, smart metering, smart cities, smartphone detection, building automation, to name a few.

Roro's mcu part use an ESP32 module from Espressif Systems. The ESP32 is a well known, widely used ultra-low-power microcontroller that incorporate connectivity options such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. It offers two CPU cores that can be individually controlled,and the CPU clock frequency is adjustable from 80 MHz to 240 MHz. The chip also has a low-powerco-processor that can be used instead of the CPU to save power while performing tasks that do not require muchcomputing power, such as monitoring of peripherals. ESP32 integrates a rich set of peripherals, ranging fromcapacitive touch sensors, Hall sensors, SD card interface, Ethernet, high-speed SPI, UART, I²S and I²C
